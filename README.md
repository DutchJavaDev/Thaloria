https://www.raylib.com/ is a very powerfull bare bones game engine (I like to call it like)

I have created simple games with it before using C, but C lacks oop (I like oop, I also like C but oop is so good hehe)

This projects uses a nuget package that C# calls to raylib C. 

If i like it I will start to make games using C# with the raylib bindings.
